# Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen Statplanner

This Programm was made in reference to this website: https://stackoverflow.github.io/dragons-dogma-stat-planner/

Initially I had no idea about there beeing an updated version with levels before level 10 to be assinged.
The features of this updated version are among the features of my version.
HOWEVER it holds even more stuff to be able to do.

Things you can do as Bulletpoints
1.    You can set stuff for both yourself AND your main pawn at the same time, including the character's name and gender.

Points for the extrapanels you can get out by pressing an 'A' or 'P' button; 2.1. and 2.2. are a different panel than 3.
2.1.  You can not only select the starting vocation but also the vocation you plan to leave the character at in the end.
2.2.  You can select the starting weight of the character along the 9 levels following your start
3.    You can set the levels of all vocations, already taking pawn limitations in account too.
      Note: Since you can't just type in a number there is a tool to make the vocationsetting easier.
4.1.  You can set your augments and see their changes to health and stamina.
4.2.  You can also see their effects on your offense as a multiplier, hardcap accounted for.
4.3.  This is all in the assumption that each selected augment is active, IGNORING all of their conditions.
5.1.  You can see what your debilitation resistances are and read up on their effects in the legend.
5.2.  You can pick out, which defensive equipmentpieces and rings you want to have on this character.
5.3.  Full equipmentsets like the set of duke's clothing, and BBI3 duplications are excluded (hence BBI heavy) for example.
5.4.  The extent of the equipment to select is just shown in minor things like health and debilitationresistances.
      Just go with BBI3 equipment if you want good defensive stats as they invalidate most equipmentpieces.
5.5.  Limitations for equipment based on your target vocation AND gender are in place, you can't select those equipmentpieces.
6.    Weapon skills based on your target vocation to assign here, as a baseline for you.

More things about the main panel
7.    Pressing the big button that keeps changing text returns the main panel to the center position.
      This action is NECESSARY if you want to save/load your settings.
8.    There are 4 savefiles which you, as a User, may utulize; the 0th savefile is for resetpurposes and should not be touched.
9.    You can exit/reset the programm anytime with the bottomost button on the main panel.
      Note: Resetting the program only wipes your CURRENT settings, NOT the savefiles.

With this kinda brief explaination I release the programm to the general public so that it may be edited or whatever.

Look, I am statisfyed with how it came out but I dunno if other people are so feel free to touch up on it if you can make it better.
